# ESP32 Wi‑Fi Stopwatch with LED Matrix Display

A **self‑contained, networked stopwatch system** built on the ESP32, designed for real‑world timing scenarios such as swimming training and competitions. The device combines **real‑time hardware display**, **local web control**, and **persistent data logging** into a single embedded system.

This project demonstrates end‑to‑end embedded development: firmware architecture, peripheral control, embedded networking, filesystem usage, and browser‑based device UI.

---

## Project Overview

The ESP32 operates as a **standalone Wi‑Fi access point**, hosting a web interface that allows users to:

* Start, stop, and reset a stopwatch remotely
* Record finished times with metadata (athlete name, pool, stroke, distance)
* View results live in the browser
* Export recorded results as a CSV file

At the same time, elapsed time is rendered in real‑time on a **MAX7219‑driven LED matrix display**, with an audible buzzer signal on start.

No internet connection, cloud services, or external infrastructure are required.

## Key Features

* **ESP32 SoftAP mode** – device-hosted Wi‑Fi network
* **Embedded HTTP server** for control and data access
* **Real‑time stopwatch** with millisecond precision
* **MAX7219 LED matrix display** (M:SS:HS format)
* **Audible start signal** via GPIO‑driven buzzer
* **SPIFFS persistent storage** for results logging
* **CSV export** for offline analysis
* **JSON API endpoint** for programmatic access
* **Browser-based UI** (HTML / CSS / JavaScript stored in flash)

---

## System Architecture

**Firmware Components**

* `WiFi.softAP()` for isolated device networking
* `WebServer` for REST-style endpoints
* `SPIFFS` for persistent CSV storage
* `Max72xxPanel` for LED matrix rendering
* Non-blocking timing using `millis()`

**Data Flow**

1. User connects to ESP32 Wi‑Fi AP
2. Browser UI sends HTTP requests (`/start`, `/stop`, `/finish`)
3. ESP32 updates hardware display in real time
4. Finished results are stored to SPIFFS as CSV
5. Data is accessible via download or JSON endpoint

## Why This Project Matters

This project was created to solve a **real, practical problem**: giving young swimmers immediate, visible feedback on their performance to encourage improvement. From an engineering perspective, it highlights the ability to:

* Build **robust standalone embedded systems**
* Combine **hardware timing constraints** with **network services**
* Design firmware that bridges **physical devices and web interfaces**
* Implement **persistent data storage** on constrained hardware

The same architectural patterns apply directly to **industrial IoT**, **test instrumentation**, **device dashboards**, and **embedded control panels**.

## Technologies Used

* **MCU:** ESP32
* **Language:** C++ (Arduino framework)
* **Networking:** Wi‑Fi SoftAP, HTTP
* **Storage:** SPIFFS
* **Display:** MAX7219 LED matrix
* **Frontend:** HTML / CSS / JavaScript

## Alignment with Professional Goals

This project reflects my focus on **embedded and IoT engineering roles** involving:

* Firmware development in C/C++
* Hardware‑software integration
* Embedded networking and device‑hosted UIs
* Designing complete, production‑style systems rather than isolated demos

It complements my broader portfolio of ESP32‑based systems, custom PCBs, and device interfaces.
